# Tutor

An experiment with AI and whiteboards.

Tutor is an infinite canvas intended for students to complete homework problems. Each page is a question, and the AI is able to either chat or draw to help the student solve the problem.

For example, if you're given a basic problem like...

> A school auditorium has 18 rows with 32 seats in each row. If tickets cost $12 each, how much money would the school collect if every seat is sold?

The large language model can...

- Provide you hints
- Draw pictures to help you visualize the problem
- Correct your mistakes
